# Progress Log

The agent appends a new entry at the top after every task, and always before a session ends.
The **Next step** line must be specific enough that a fresh session can continue without guessing.

## Current status

- Last completed task: P1.3
- **Next step:** P1.4 brand & tool probe (Canva logo exploration → hand-built SVG logo set; Figma probe; `pen status`).
- Staging URL: — (workers.dev subdomain `mhodieknowledge`) · Figma file: — · CI status: —
